//   - 'start' : we'd been driving, then stationary >= 2 min, and NO active session
//   - 'stop'  : sustained driving movement while a session IS active
// Each prompt fires once per transition, never repeatedly.
//
// Driving only counts once it has lasted `drivingConfirmMs`. A single fast
// sample is not a drive: with the phone lying still, GPS fixes wander 10-20 m,
// and when the device reports no speed of its own that wander reads as 10+ m/s.
// For the same reason a speed we derive ourselves is only trusted when the car
// moved further than the two fixes' combined error radius — and since phones
// often claim better accuracy than they have, a drive must also carry the phone
// `drivingMinMeters` from where it began. Wander, however fast it looks, never
// gets anywhere.
